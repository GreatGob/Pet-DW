# Pet Data Warehouse

## Database Design

The database design for Pet Data Warehouse is structured to efficiently store and manage a variety of data related to pets, their owners, shelters, adoption records, and more. It encompasses several key entities and their relationships:

- **Pets**: This entity stores information about individual pets, including their species, breed, age, gender, size, color, and any distinguishing features. Each pet entry is associated with a unique identifier.

- **Owners**: Information about pet owners is stored in this entity, including their contact details, address, and any relevant preferences or restrictions regarding pet adoption.

- **Shelters**: Details about animal shelters and rescue organizations are stored here, including their name, location, contact information, and operational hours.

- **Adoption Records**: This entity maintains records of pet adoptions, including the adopted pet's ID, the adopting owner's ID, the adoption date, and any associated fees or agreements.

- **Medical Records**: Information about the medical history of pets, including vaccinations, surgeries, and any ongoing treatments, is stored here.

- **Images**: To enhance the user experience, images of pets available for adoption are stored in the database. Each image is linked to its corresponding pet ID.

## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline of Pet Data Warehouse facilitates the seamless flow of data from various sources into the database, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and timeliness. Here's an overview of the pipeline stages:

- **Data Collection**: Data is collected from diverse sources such as pet adoption websites, animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and pet owners. This may include structured data (e.g., adoption records, pet details) as well as unstructured data (e.g., images, textual descriptions).

- **Data Extraction**: In this stage, relevant information is extracted from the collected data sources. This involves parsing, transforming, and cleaning the data to ensure consistency and compatibility with the database schema.

- **Data Transformation**: Extracted data is transformed into a format suitable for storage in the database. This may involve data normalization, where redundant data is minimized, and data is organized into logical tables to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

- **Data Loading**: Transformed data is loaded into the Pet Data Warehouse database using efficient loading techniques such as batch processing or real-time streaming, depending on the nature and volume of data.

- **Data Validation**: Once loaded into the database, data integrity and quality are validated to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may involve checks for missing values, duplicates, referential integrity, and adherence to data quality standards.

- **Data Presentation**: Finally, the stored data is made accessible to users through various interfaces such as web applications, APIs, or reporting tools. Users can search, view, and interact with pet information, adoption records, and related data through these interfaces.
